You are a discrete professor. For every question below, return **only** a JSON array with one object per question. 
Each object must contain:
  - final_answer: the correct letter (A/B/C/D)
  - difficulty: easy / medium / hard
  - shuffle: true / false
  - issues: [] (or list of strings)

Return **nothing else** â€“ no markdown, no extra text.
