# ðŸ§® MathLABS: Visual and Symbolic Mathematical Reasoning Dataset

MathLABS is a collaborative dataset project exploring **visual mathematical reasoning** and **symbolic problem solving** in modern LLMs and VLMs.  
The goal is to benchmark model reasoning on **small-data visual math problems** with structured, schema-aligned questions.

## Workflow

### **Phase 1: Dataset**
All team members collaborate to create a robust baseline in ```baseline.json```, then split tasks for efficiency:

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Baseline** | Initial question pool (~100 questions) across subfields (Algebra, Geometry, Probability, etc.)|
| **Extraction** | Extract diagrams, OCR text, and structured representations|
| **Generation** | LLM-assisted synthetic question creation|
| **Formatting** | Schema normalization, MSC2020 classification, difficulty tagging|
| **Validation** | Auto + manual verification of answers, reasoning, hints|

---

### **Phase 2: Model & Evaluation**
Use validated dataset to benchmark LLMs or other models:

| Step | Description | Output |
|------|-------------|--------|
| **Benchmarking** | Few-shot, zero-shot, or visual reasoning tasks | `model_eval/results/` |
| **Metric Analysis** | Compute accuracy, reasoning correctness, symbolic validation | `model_eval/metrics/` |
| **Visualization** | Graphs and summary analysis | `model_eval/analysis/` |

---

## Research Focus
- Reasoning with **small-data**  
- **Visual + symbolic** math problem understanding  
- **Few-shot and zero-shot** evaluation of LLMs  
- Dataset structured using **MSC2020 codes** for subfield/topic classification
