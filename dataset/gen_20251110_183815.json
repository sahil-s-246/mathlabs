      "explanation": "A vector $\\mathbf{v}$ is a scalar multiple of $\\mathbf{u}_1$ if $\\mathbf{v} = c \\mathbf{u}_1$ for some scalar $c$. This means each component of $\\mathbf{v}$ must be $c$ times the corresponding component of $\\mathbf{u}_1$. \nGiven $\\mathbf{u}_1 = \\begin{bmatrix} 3 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}$.\nLet's check the options:\n*   A: $\\begin{bmatrix} 6 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}$. If $c\\mathbf{u}_1 = \\begin{bmatrix} 6 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}$, then $3c=6 \\Rightarrow c=2$. But $1c=1 \\Rightarrow c=1$. Since $c$ is not consistent, it's not a scalar multiple.\n*   B: $\\begin{bmatrix} 3 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}$. If $c\\mathbf{u}_1 = \\begin{bmatrix} 3 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}$, then $3c=3 \\Rightarrow c=1$. But $0c=1$ is impossible. Not a scalar multiple.\n*   C: $\\begin{bmatrix} 6 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 2 \\end{bmatrix}$. If $c\\mathbf{u}_1 = \\begin{bmatrix} 6 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 2 \\end{bmatrix}$, then $3c=6 \\Rightarrow c=2$. And $0c=0$, which is true for $c=2$. And $1c=2 \\Rightarrow c=2$. Since $c=2$ is consistent for all components, this is a scalar multiple ($2\\mathbf{u}_1$).\n*   D: $\\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 6 \\\\ 2 \\end{bmatrix}$. If $c\\mathbf{u}_1 = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 6 \\\\ 2 \\end{bmatrix}$, then $3c=0 \\Rightarrow c=0$. But $0c=6$ is impossible for $c=0$. Not a scalar multiple.\nTherefore, option C is the correct answer.",
