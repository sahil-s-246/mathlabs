  "solution": "The vector $\\mathbf{x}$ **is** in $H$, and its coordinate vector relative to $\\mathcal{B}$ is: $$\\left[\\mathbf{x}\\right]_{\\mathcal{B}} = \\begin{bmatrix} 4 \\\\ 9 \\end{bmatrix}$$\n\n**Calculation:**\nWe test for consistency of $c_1\\mathbf{v}_1 + c_2\\mathbf{v}_2 = \\mathbf{x}$ by forming the augmented matrix and row reducing:\n$$\\begin{bmatrix} 3 & -1 & \\mid & 3 \\\\ 6 & 0 & \\mid & 12 \\\\ 2 & 1 & \\mid & 7 \\end{bmatrix}$$\n\n1. $R_2 \\to R_2 - 2R_1$: \n$$\\begin{bmatrix} 3 & -1 & \\mid & 3 \\\\ 0 & 2 & \\mid & 6 \\\\ 2 & 1 & \\mid & 7 \\end{bmatrix}$$\n\n2. $R_2 \\to \\frac{1}{2}R_2$: $\\implies c_2 = 3$\n$$\\begin{bmatrix} 3 & -1 & \\mid & 3 \\\\ 0 & 1 & \\mid & 3 \\\\ 2 & 1 & \\mid & 7 \\end{bmatrix}$$\n\n3. Back-substitute $c_2 = 3$ into $R_1$: $3c_1 - 1(3) = 3 \\implies 3c_1 = 6 \\implies c_1 = 2$\n\n4. Check consistency with $R_3$: $2c_1 + 1c_2 = 2(2) + 1(3) = 4 + 3 = 7$. Since $7=7$, the system is consistent, and $\\mathbf{x}$ is in $H$.\n\n*Note: The calculated solution is $c_1=2, c_2=3$. The example solution in the textbook is $c_1=4, c_2=9$. Let's re-examine the textbook solution.* \n\n**Following the textbook solution $\\left[\\mathbf{x}\\right]_{\\mathcal{B}} = \\begin{bmatrix} 4 \\\\ 9 \\end{bmatrix}$:**\n$$4\\mathbf{v}_1 + 9\\mathbf{v}_2 = 4\\begin{bmatrix} 3 \\\\ 6 \\\\ 2 \\end{bmatrix} + 9\\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 12 \\\\ 24 \\\\ 8 \\end{bmatrix} + \\begin{bmatrix} -9 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 9 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 3 \\\\ 24 \\\\ 17 \\end{bmatrix}$$\n\nThis result $\\begin{bmatrix} 3 \\\\ 24 \\\\ 17 \\end{bmatrix}$ **does not** equal $\\mathbf{x} = \\begin{bmatrix} 3 \\\\ 12 \\\\ 7 \\end{bmatrix}$. The textbook's stated solution (which is for a different $\\mathbf{x}$ or different $\\mathbf{v}$ vectors) is incorrect for the stated problem vectors. \n\n**The correct coordinate vector for the given vectors is $c_1=2, c_2=3$.**\n\n$$\\left[\\mathbf{x}\\right]_{\\mathcal{B}} = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\\\ 3 \\end{bmatrix}$$",
