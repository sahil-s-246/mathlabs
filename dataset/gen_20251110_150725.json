      "explanation": "This statement is **False**. This equality only holds under specific conditions, not for *any* non-zero vectors.\nRecall the formula for the dot product in terms of magnitudes and the angle $\\theta$ between the vectors:\n$\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = ||\\mathbf{u}|| ||\\mathbf{v}|| \\cos \\theta$.\nSquaring both sides:\n$(\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v})^2 = (||\\mathbf{u}|| ||\\mathbf{v}|| \\cos \\theta)^2 = ||\\mathbf{u}||^2 ||\\mathbf{v}||^2 \\cos^2 \\theta$.\nFor the statement $(\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v})^2 = ||\\mathbf{u}||^2 ||\\mathbf{v}||^2$ to be true, we must have $\\cos^2 \\theta = 1$. This implies that $\\cos \\theta = 1$ or $\\cos \\theta = -1$, meaning the angle $\\theta$ between the vectors must be $0$ or $\\pi$ radians. In other words, the vectors $\\mathbf{u}$ and $\\mathbf{v}$ must be parallel (linearly dependent).\nIf the vectors are not parallel (e.g., orthogonal), then $\\cos^2 \\theta < 1$, and thus $(\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v})^2 < ||\\mathbf{u}||^2 ||\\mathbf{v}||^2$. This is a direct consequence of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, which states $|\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}| \\le ||\\mathbf{u}|| ||\\mathbf{v}||$.\nFor example, let $\\mathbf{u} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ and $\\mathbf{v} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n$\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = 1(0) + 0(1) = 0$. So $(\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v})^2 = 0^2 = 0$.\n$||\\mathbf{u}||^2 = 1^2 + 0^2 = 1$. $||\\mathbf{v}||^2 = 0^2 + 1^2 = 1$.\nThen $||\\mathbf{u}||^2 ||\\mathbf{v}||^2 = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$. Since $0 \\ne 1$, the statement is false for these vectors.",
